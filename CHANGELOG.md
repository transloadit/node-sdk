Released: 2025-09-18.

[Diff](https://github.com/transloadit/node-sdk/compare/v3.0.2...v4.0.0).

- [x] **Breaking:** Package is now pure ESM, requires Node.js 20+, and exports `{ Transloadit }` instead of a default client.
- [x] **Breaking** `TransloaditError` removed in favor of a new, slightly different `ApiError`.
- [x] Added end-to-end TypeScript typings for robots, assemblies, templates, and responses, so assembly instructions now autocomplete every robot and its supported parameters. Notably, Assembly instructions and statuses are validates against rich TypeScript types; migrate to the new `AssemblyInstructionsInput` types and `AssemblyStatus` in responses.
- [x] New rich error stacktraces that aid in debugging issues.
- [x] Added opt-in `validateResponses` safeguard and a `getSignedSmartCDNUrl` helper for generating signed Smart CDN URLs.
