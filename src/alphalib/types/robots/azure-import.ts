Please create your associated <dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> in your Transloadit account and use the name of your [Template Credentials](/c/template-credentials/) as this parameter's value. They will contain the values for your Azure Container, Account and Key.

While we recommend to use <dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> at all times, some use cases demand dynamic credentials for which using <dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> is too unwieldy because of their static nature. If you have this requirement, feel free to use the following parameters instead: \`"account"\`, \`"key"\`, \`"container"\`.
`),
    path: path.describe(`
The path in your container to the specific file or directory. If the path points to a file, only this file will be imported. For example: \`images/avatar.jpg\`.

If it points to a directory, indicated by a trailing slash (\`/\`), then all files that are descendants of this directory are recursively imported. For example: \`images/\`.

If you want to import all files from the root directory, please use \`/\` as the value here.

You can also use an array of path strings here to import multiple paths in the same <dfn>Robot</dfn>'s <dfn>Step</dfn>.
`),

A string token used for pagination. The returned files of one paginated call have the next page token inside of their meta data, which needs to be used for the subsequent paging call.
`),

The pagination page size. This only works when recursive is \`true\` for now, in order to not break backwards compatibility in non-recursive imports.
