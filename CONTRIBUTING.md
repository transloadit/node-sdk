## Testing

This project is tested using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). There are two kinds of tests.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are in the [`test/unit`](test/unit) folder of the project. You can run them using the following command:

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

This will also generate a coverage report in the `coverage` directory.

### Integration tests

Integration tests are in the [`test/integration`](test/integration) folder. They require some extra setup.

Firstly, these tests require the Cloudflare executable. You can download this with:

```sh
curl -fsSLo cloudflared-linux-amd64 https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64
chmod +x cloudflared-linux-amd64
```

They also require a Transloadit key and secret, which you can get from https://transloadit.com/c/credentials.

You can run the integration tests with:

```sh
TRANSLOADIT_KEY='YOUR_TRANSLOADIT_KEY' TRANSLOADIT_SECRET='YOUR_TRANSLOADIT_SECRET' CLOUDFLARED_PATH='./cloudflared-linux-amd64' yarn test:integration
```

### Code Coverage

Coverage reports are:

- Generated locally in the `coverage` directory
- Uploaded to Codecov for tracking
- Enforced in CI (builds will fail if coverage drops below thresholds)

View the coverage report locally by opening `coverage/index.html` in your browser.

## Releasing

Only maintainers can make releases. Releases to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) are automated using GitHub actions. To make a release, perform the following steps:

1. Update the version using npm, `npm version patch`. This will update the version in the `package.json` file and create a git tag. E.g.:
  - `npm version patch`
  - `npm version prerelease` (for pre-releases)
2. Push the tag to GitHub: `git push origin main --tags`
3. If the tests pass, GitHub actions will now publish the new version to npm.
4. When successful add [release notes](https://github.com/transloadit/node-sdk/releases).
5. If this was a pre-release, remember to run this to reset the [npm `latest` tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/transloadit?activeTab=versions
) to the previous version (replace `x.y.z` with previous version):
  - `npm dist-tag add transloadit@X.Y.Z latest`
