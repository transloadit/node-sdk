### TS7056 ("type exceeds maximum length")

Our fix: give the huge Zod `discriminatedUnion` an **explicit** facade type (`z.ZodType`). The compiler still checks the real union at _usage_ sites, but prints only the facade in `.d.ts`, so it never hits its internal size limit.

The key insight is that TypeScript's TS7056 error occurs during declaration file generation when `"declaration": true` is set in tsconfig. By using `z.ZodType` as the type annotation (without type parameters), we prevent TypeScript from trying to serialize the entire discriminated union structure in the `.d.ts` files.

#### Alternative (not implemented)

Use a d.ts-bundler (rollup-dts / api-extractor, â€¦). We'd run `tsc --noEmit` and let the bundler write one flattened `.d.ts` that drops over-verbose types. Useful if we ever need to ship _fully_ expanded typings. This is how e.g. Prisma does it.
