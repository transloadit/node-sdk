# Council Refactoring Ideas

## Overview

Run the local `council.ts refactor` script to get multi-agent refactoring brainstorms, then triage
and address valid issues before final validation and PR creation.

## Workflow

Run `~/code/dotfiles/bin/council.ts refactor` to get some more refactoring ideas and see which ones
make sense.
