- For CLI scripts, use TypeScript
- Use tsx vs ts-node
- If we need complex CLI arg parsing use Clipanion & Typanion
- Use execa for running commands. We use version 4 because not all repo's are ESM compatible yet
- Use dotenv to load secrets
- Have one main() or run() method that catches fails and exit(1) the process. Then have less excessive try/catches throughout the entire script
- Use `import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto'` vs `import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'`
