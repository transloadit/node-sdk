Coding style:

- Favor `async run() {` over `run = async () => {` inside ES6 classes
- Favor `if (!(err instanceof Error)) { throw new Error(`Was thrown a non-error: ${err}`) }` inside
  `catch` blocks to ensure the `error` is always an instance of `Error`
- Favor using real paths (`../lib/schemas.ts`) over aliases (`@/app/lib/schemas`).
- Favor `for (const comment of comments) {` over `comments.forEach((comment) => {`
- Favor named exports over default exports, with the exception of Next.js pages
- Do not wrap each function body and function call in `try`/`catch` blocks. It pollutes the code.
  Assume we will always have an e.g.
  `main().catch((err) => { console.error(err); process.exit(1) })` to catch us. I repeat: Avoid
  over-use of try-catch such as
  `try { // foo } catch (err) { console.error('error while foo'); throw err }`, assume we catch
  errors on a higher level and do not need the extra explananation.
- If you must use try/catch, for simple cases, favor `alphalib/tryCatch.ts`
  (`const [err, data] = await tryCatch(promise)`) over
  `let data; try { data = await promise } catch (err) { }`
- Before creating new files and new code, see if we can leverage existing work, maybe slighty adapt
  that without breaking BC, to keep things DRY.
- Favor early exits, so quickly `continue`, `return false` (or `throw` if needed), over nesting
  everything in positive conditions, creating christmas trees.
- Use Prettier with 100 char line width, single quotes for JS/TS, semi: false
- Use descriptive names: PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for variables/methods/schemas
- Alphabetize imports, group by source type (built-in/external/internal)
- Favor US English over UK English, so `summarizeError` over `summarise Error`
- Favor `.replaceAll('a', 'b)` over `.replace(/a/g, 'b')` or `.replace(new RegExp('a', 'g'), 'b')` when the only need for regeses was replacing all strings. That's usually both easier to read and more performant.
- Use typographic characters: ellipsis (`…`) instead of `...`, curly quotes (`'` `"`) instead of straight quotes in user-facing text
- Put API keys and secrets in `.env` files, not hardcoded in components
- Check for existing hooks before creating new ones (e.g., `useUppy()` for Uppy functionality)
