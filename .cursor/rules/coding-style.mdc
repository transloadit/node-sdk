Coding style:

- Favor `async run() {` over `run = async () => {` inside ES6 classes
- Favor `if (!(err instanceof Error)) { throw new Error(`Was thrown a non-error: ${err}`) }` inside
  `catch` blocks to ensure the `error` is always an instance of `Error`
- Favor using real paths (`../lib/schemas.ts`) over aliases (`@/app/lib/schemas`).
- Favor `for (const comment of comments) {` over `comments.forEach((comment) => {`
- Favor named exports over default exports, with the exception of Next.js pages
- Do not wrap each function body and function call in `try`/`catch` blocks. It pollutes the code. Assume we will always have an e.g. `main().catch((err) => { console.error(err); process.exit(1) })` to catch us. I repeat: Avoid over-use of try-catch such as `try { // foo } catch (err) { console.error('error while foo'); throw err }`, assume we catch errors on a higher level and do not need the extra explananation.
- Before creating new files and new code, see if we can leverage existing work, maybe slighty adapt that without breaking BC, to keep things DRY.
- Favor early exits, so quickly `continue`, `return false` (or `throw` if needed), over nesting everything in positive conditions, creating christmas trees.
- Use Prettier with 100 char line width, single quotes for JS/TS, semi: false
- Use descriptive names: PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for variables/methods/schemas
- Alphabetize imports, group by source type (built-in/external/internal)
