- In case of Next.js, we use the `./src` directory, version 15, the App Router, and we have
  shadcn/ui installed (`npx shadcn@latest add <component>`). Assume we have a dev server running so
  never start one unless specifically prompted.
- In case of Next.js, our config file is `next.config.ts`. Don't work in js or mjs alternatives.
