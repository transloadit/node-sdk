# Transloadit Node.js SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/transloadit/node-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/transloadit/node-sdk)

This is the official Node.js SDK for Transloadit. It's been provided by the founders but everybody is encouraged to suggest ideas or code for improvement.

## Install

Inside your project, type

```bash
npm install --save --save-exact transloadit
```

If there are no errors, you can start using the module.

## Use

```javascript
var TransloaditClient = require('transloadit');
var transloadit       = new TransloaditClient({
  authKey    : 'YOUR_AUTH_KEY',
  authSecret : 'YOUR_AUTH_SECRET'
});

transloadit.addFile('file1', filePath);
var assemblyOptions = {
  params: {
    template_id: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'
  }
};
transloadit.createAssembly(assemblyOptions, function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    throw new Error(err);
  }

  console.log('success');

  var assemblyId = result.assembly_id;
  console.log({
    assemblyId: assemblyId
  });

  transloadit.deleteAssembly(assemblyId, function(err) {
    console.log('deleted');
  });
});
```

## API

These are the public methods on the `TransloaditClient` object and their descriptions.

### Main

#### constructor([options])

Returns a new instance of the client. The `options` object must at least include `authKey` and `authSecret` keys (and their values).

You can also provide `service`, which defaults to `"api2.transloadit.com"`, and `region`, which defaults to `"us-east-1"`.

By default `TransloaditClient` will use SSL so it will access `service` with a https:// prefix. You can switch this off by providing options.useSsl with a value of `false`.

#### calcSignature(params)

Calculates a signature for the given `params` JSON object. If the `params` object does not include an `authKey` or `expires` keys (and their values) in the `auth` sub-key, then they are set automatically.

This function returns an object with the key `signature` (containing the calculated signature string) and a key `params`, which contains the stringified version of the passed `params` object (including the set expires and authKey keys).

### Assemblies

#### TransloaditClient.addFile(name, path)

Registers the local file with the client. The next call to `createAssembly` will upload that file.

If the file does not exist when addFile() is invoked, an ENOENT error will be thrown.

#### TransloaditClient.addStream(name, stream)

Registers the provided stream with the client. The next call to `createAssembly` will upload that stream.

#### TransloaditClient.createAssembly(options, cb)

Creates a new assembly on Transloadit, uploading all streams and files that were registered via `.addStream()` and `.addFile()` prior to the call to `.createAssembly()`.

You can provide some options:

* `params` - an object containing your `template_id`, `notify_url`, some steps that overwrite your Transloadit template and other params to control Transloadit behavior.
* `fields` - an object of form fields to add to the request, to make use of in the assembly via [assembly variables](https://transloadit.com/docs#assembly-variables).

This function (like all functions of this client) automatically obeys all rate limiting imposed by Transloadit. There is no need to write your own
wrapper scripts to handle rate limits.

#### TransloaditClient.lastUsedAssemblyUrl()

Returns the internal url that was used for the last call to `Transloadit.createAssembly()`. This is meant to be used for debugging purposes.

#### TransloaditClient.listAssemblies(params, cb)

Retrieves an array of assemblies according to the given `params`.

Valid params can be page, pagesize, type, fromdate and todate. Please consult the [Transloadit API docs](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs/#retrieve-assembly-list) for details.

#### TransloaditClient.streamAssemblies(params)

Creates an objectMode readable stream that automates handling of listAssembly
pagination. It accepts the same params as listAssembly.

This can be used to iterate through assemblies:

```javascript
var assemblyStream = client.streamAssemblies({ fromdate: "2016-08-19 01:15:00 UTC" });

assemblyStream.on("readable", function() {
  var assembly = assemblyStream.read();
  if (assembly == null) console.log("end of stream");

  console.log(assembly.id);
});
```

Results can also be piped. Here's an example using
[through2](https://github.com/rvagg/through2):

```javascript
var assemblyStream = client.streamAssemblies({ fromdate: "2016-08-19 01:15:00 UTC" });

assemblyStream
  .pipe(through.obj(function(chunk, enc, callback) {
    this.push(chunk.id + "\n");
    callback();
  }))
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream("assemblies.txt");
```

#### TransloaditClient.getAssembly(assemblyId, cb)

Retrieves the JSON status of the assembly identified by the given `assemblyId`.

#### TransloaditClient.deleteAssembly(assemblyId, cb)

Removes the assembly identified by the given `assemblyId` from the memory of the Transloadit machines, ultimately cancelling it. This does not delete the assembly from the database - you can still access it on `https://transloadit.com/assemblies/{assembly_id}` in your Transloadit account. This also does not delete any files associated with the assembly from the Transloadit servers.

#### TransloaditClient.replayAssembly(options, cb)

Replays the assembly identified by the given `assembly_id`. The `options` parameter must contain an `assembly_id` key containing the assembly id. Optionally you can also provide a `notify_url` key if you want to change the notification target.

### Assembly notifications

#### TransloaditClient.replayAssemblyNotification(options, cb)

Replays the notification for the assembly identified by the given `assembly_id`.  The `options` parameter must contain an `assembly_id` key containing the assembly id. Optionally you can also provide a `notify_url` key if you want to change the notification target.

#### TransloaditClient.listAssemblyNotifications(params, cb)

Retrieves an array of assembly notifications according to the given `params`.

Valid params can be `page`, `pagesize`, `type` and `assembly_id`. Please consult the [Transloadit API docs](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs/#retrieve-assembly-notification-list) for details.

#### TransloaditClient.streamAssemblyNotifications(params)

Creates an objectMode readable stream like streamAssemblies that automates
handling of listAssemblynotifications pagination.

### Templates

#### TransloaditClient.createTemplate(params, cb)

Creates a template the provided params. The required `params` keys are: name (the template name) and template (the template JSON string).

#### TransloaditClient.editTemplate(templateId, params, cb)

Updates the template represented by the given `templateId` with the new value. The `params` works just like the one from the `createTemplate` call.

#### TransloaditClient.getTemplate(templateId, cb)

Retrieves the name and the template JSON for the template represented by the given templateId.

#### TransloaditClient.deleteTemplate(templateId, cb)

Deletes the template represented by the given templateId on Transloadit.

#### TransloaditClient.listTemplates(params, cb)

Retrieves a list of all your templates from Transloadit. The `params` parameter can contain properties such as `order`, `sort`, and `page`. For a list of all available params please check [this entry](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs/#retrieve-template-list) in the Transloadit API docs.

#### TransloaditClient.streamTemplates(params)

Creates an objectMode readable stream like streamAssemblies that automates
handling of listTemplates pagination.

## Contributing

We'd be happy to accept pull requests. If you plan on working on something big, please first drop us a line!

### Building

The SDK is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), but the JavaScript it generates is commited back into the repository so people can use this module without a CoffeeScript dependency. If you want to work on the source, please do so in `./src` and type: `npm run build` or `npm run test` (also builds first). Please don't edit generated JavaScript in `./lib`!

### Testing

Check your sources for linting errors via `npm run lint`, and unit tests, and run them via `npm run test`, or `npm run mocha` for faster iterations.

### Releasing

Releasing a new version to npmjs.org can be done via `npm run release:major` (or minor / patch, depending on the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) impact of your changes). This will automatically:

 - Bump the version inside the `package.json`
 - Save a release commit with the updated version in Git
 - Push a tag to Github
 - Publish to npmjs.org

### Convenience

If you come from a unix background and fancy faster auto-complete, you'll be delighted to know that all npm scripts are also accessible under `make`, via fakefile.


## Changelog

### 1.9.0
- Adding support for rate limiting to all functionality.
- Adding `TransloaditClient.streamAssemblies`.
- Improved API error reporting.
- Adding more tests.
